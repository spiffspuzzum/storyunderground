I can barely see the flashing lights of the cops so I check the speedometer. 157 mph. Not bad. Years ago I was clocked doing 162.

We had ripped out the backseat to cut weight, so he was sitting on an inflatable pool mattress that looked like a magical seahorse.</p></blockquote>`,

It’s a woman with dyed chestnut hair, just like my mother’s, and she stumbles towards the shredder. I close my eyes just before she falls in, but I can still hear the heavy blades grind up her bones. The military is working on a cure, trying to restore the humanity of the zombies. I wonder what it would mean if they succeed. I’ve killed so many.'</p></blockquote>`,

All it takes is the sound. I don’t have to take my eyes off the road much, only during the good parts.  So I’m horny as hell by the time I roll into the gas station at sunrise.</p></blockquote>`,
