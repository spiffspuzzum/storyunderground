        <h1>A Most Unpleasant Endeavour</h1>
        <p>When a mountain that devours everything in its path oozes out of the wilderness and threatens to eat their home, Thurston P. Merryweather III, a dapper stuffed bear, and his plushie friends set off on truly dangerous adventure to slay the beast.</p>
        <p>Dearest reader, although the characters in this story are stuffed animals (or plushies as they prefer to be called), this unabridged account contains scary and disturbing events, tragedy and suffering, and yes, even death.</p>
        <p>If you are young or have a gentle heart and happen to read this book, indecent tattoos may suddenly appear on your newly muscled forearms and a handlebar mustache may sprout from your face.</p>
        <p>You have been warned.</p>

        <h1>Into the Strange</h1>
        <p>Marie just moved to China, and she hates it. </p>
        <p>She's an adventurous and stubborn twelve year old girl from a small farm in rural Oregon. She had to leave her dog and dirt bike behind, and now she's being bullied at school and hasn't made a single friend.</p> 
        <p>Wayne, her optimistic redneck father, moved them to this futuristic and frenetic city hoping to give her a brighter future, but Marie feels trapped. She didn't choose to come here, and she thinks that she'll never fit in.</p> 
        <p>So after they have an especially heated argument, she runs away from home and tries to make it on her own in the chaotic and surreal megalopolis.</p>

        <h1>Boost</h1>
        <p>I’m waiting at a stoplight, driving a stolen car, and a cop pulls up behind me.</p>
        <blockquote>
          <p>I cover a couple miles before glancing in the mirror. I can barely see the flashing lights of the cops so I check the speedometer. 157 mph.  Not bad. Years ago I was clocked doing 162. Mario, Russell, and I had just dropped a Type-R motor (B18C5, no turbo) into my 93’ Civic hatchback and were nuking down I-5 just to see how fast it would go.</p>
          <p>“Hey, I think that was a cop,” Russell said and pointed at an unmarked car hiding under the overpass by the Fairview Walmart. We had ripped out the backseat to cut weight, so he was sitting on an inflatable pool mattress that looked like a magical seahorse.</p>

        <h1>Happy Fun Times Distribution</h1>
        <p>Will an aging male stripper win a record four NASTis (Northwest Annual Stripper Trials) in a row, or will celebrity judge and 70s porn legend Rod Holder mean the end of his reign?</p>
        <blockquote>
          <p>When the snack tray is empty, Sid whips his hairnet into the frenzied crowd, removes his condiment stained shirt with a practiced flick of the wrist, and begins to dance. Patrons start tossing dollar bills onto the stage, and Sid clicks the buttons on his heavy change-belt, showering them with nickels and dimes.</p>
          <p>"I'm the only stripper that will give change for a dollar."</p>

        <h1>Across the Ashes</h1>
        <p>When the new recruit, a moody loner, falls asleep at the wheel of a zombie grinding tank and crashes into an elementary school, will the crew be able to fight off the horde of child zombies?</p>
        <blockquote>
          <p>"...then I watch a lone zombie climb into the tank. It’s a woman with dyed chestnut hair, just like my mother’s, and she stumbles towards the shredder. I close my eyes just before she falls in, but I can still hear the heavy blades grind up her bones. The military is working on a cure, trying to restore the humanity of the zombies. I wonder what it would mean if they succeed. I’ve killed so many."</p>
